- **Developer IDs**

On Discord, every username can have 9999 variants of it before it becomes unavailable. 
Trying to ban someone by just putting "Eternalll" is extremely dangerous. 
This is why we use `Developer IDs`_ instead, they provide a number such as 349909910995206145 (my ID) that ensures you are punishing the correct person.
Please enable this feature immediately.

- **Moderation Bot**

Edward Richtofen#5103 is the main moderation bot for all things. 
The prefix is **!** for all their commands. With great power comes great responsibility.

Issuing Punishments
------------

.. warning::
    :ref:`Be aware that all bot-issued punishments are direct-messaged to the user. Refrain from using vague or immature reasons.`

- **Optional vs Required**

When navigating this section, be aware that items in <brackets> are required and that items in (parenthesis) are optional.

.. note::
    :ref:`You do not actually use brackets and parenthesis at all when issuing moderations, they are for reference.`
