Overview
------------
.. warning::
    :ref:`All information here is considered semi-confidential. There is no reason for a non-Staff member to read this information.`

Modmail is a bot-assisted system by which the Call of Duty Zombies moderators are able to efficiently communicate privately with other members of the server about various issues or topics. 
Mostly, it is used for members to report rule-breaking members and ask general questions.

Scope and Usage
------------

- **Modmail is for serious inquiries or reports only.**

Questions about the server or reports of rule breaking behavior by other members are valid reasons for reaching out to Modmail. 
Members asking if anyone wants to play, or making small talk with no direct intent to do any of the formerly listed valid reasons for opening Modmail constitutes a closure of the thread.

- **Evidence is always required.**

When a rule violation is reported, the member must have evidence. If occurring in voice, the Discord overlay or showing of the voice channel is required.

- **We are not game tech support.**

We are not associated with Activision or Treyarch. Therefore, we cannot assist with in-game issues outside of directing a user to forums and official support to steer them in the proper direction.

- **Modmail Abuse**

We will cover how to counteract abuse of the Modmail system. For now, just know that repeated abuses of the Modmail system may justify a punishment being placed on the account, and a block from using Modmail.

Basic Commands
------------

- **!note**

This command is used to speak within a thread in Staff-only mode. Messages sent prefixed by this command will not send any messages to the user.

.. tip::
    :ref:`Please use this to converse among Staff and make comments until you are ready to communicate with the member.`

- **!ar <text>**

Anonymously send a message to the member who invoked the Modmail. The only caveat is that your highest *hoisted* role will be shown alongside the anonymous label.

- **!edit <number> <new text>**

Edit your responses to Modmail. Use the number **#** in the footer as a reference for which response to edit.

.. attention::
    :ref:`Edited responses are viewable by the Staff team in the logs channel.`

- **!delete <number>**

Delete your responses to Modmail. Use the number **#** in the footer as a reference for which response to edit.

.. attention::
    :ref:`Deleted responses are viewable by the Staff team in the logs channel.`

- **!newthread <userid>**

Use this to silently invoke a Modmail thread with a specified user if they are having issues reaching out to Modmail, or if you need to privately ask them something.

.. note::
    :ref:`This thread creation method does not ping the Modmail Reports role.`

- **!close (time)**

Close a Modmail thread, optionally with a time specified before automatically closing.

- **!block (time)**

Block a user from opening a Modmail for a specified time. You should always place a timed block instead of a permanent block. Reserve this for repeated abuses of the system.

- **!snips**

Invoke a list of snippets you can send to the user to save time typing the same thing.

- **!!<snip>**

Use a listed snip within the Modmail thread. Add an extra **!** to send it anonymously.

- **!alert**

Ask that the Modmail bot notify you of any new responses received within the thread.

.. tip::
    :ref:`You can disable this by issuing the command !alert cancel.`
