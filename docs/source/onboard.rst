Intro
------------
.. warning::
    :ref:`All information here is considered semi-confidential. There is no reason for a non-Staff member to read this information.`

- **Introduction**

Welcome to the Call of Duty Zombies Staff onboard channel. You will navigate and learn the basics of moderating here. 
There is a lot of information to become familar with; you do not need to know absolutely everything in the beginning. 
If you are a current Staff member returning to this page, welcome back!


- **Trial Moderator Position**

As a Trial Mod, you are a regular Moderator with regards to permissions (with a few restrictions), but under Trial. 
At this point you are to learn from our Staff, performing a few moderations within your two week period.

You should:

    • Watch the other Staff for how situations are handled.

    • Monitor channels for rule breakings.

    • Participate in moderation when confident.

- **Staff Hierarchy**

All Staff are above you at this point. Please ask questions if you are interested in how or why a situation was handled.

    1. Administrator

    2. Community Manager

    3. Senior Moderator

    4. Moderator

    5. Trial Moderator

.. important::
    :ref:`Administration members may demote you at any time for any reason.`

- **Appeals**

You may not unban a user unless you are Senior Moderator or above. 
Join the `appeal server here`_ and watch the process after you become a Trial.

- **Responsibility**

Your responsibility is ensuring that members are able to look for groups in a peaceful environment, stepping in when rules are violated by members. 
If there are members who have a private issue with the server, such as another member, you should ask them to direct message Modmail to prevent drama in our public channels. 

There is a concept called "Spirit of the Rules" that should be taken into consideration. 
It is more important that you focus on the intent of the rules, rather than following them like a book. 
Moderators should use their judgment to enforce rules only when it makes sense.

Code of Conduct
------------

- **Checks and Balances**

It is important to frequently check and validate other moderation actions when necessary. 
This keeps all of us in check whether we may have punished too little or too much. 
Staff hierarchy is in place if the verdict is challenged.

- **Breaks**

For breaks of two weeks or above, use **!staffid** and fill the time off form. 
You will be asked a series of questions regarding your leave. 
You are under no obligation to continually moderate when life becomes busy and you require a break.

.. warning::
    :ref:`Taking a leave of absense during your Trial results in an immediate termination. If it is an emergency that you absolutely must take care of, please contact your mentor.`

- **Inactivity**

If activity is not enough, this can lead to demotion. Activity is a combination of moderation and/or chatting in public channels or staff chats frequently. 
If you are blatantly ignoring moderations when showing active or not participating at all, this will be treated as inactivity.

- **Disclipline**

Staff are to remain in control of a situation at all times and should never stoop down to the level that the offending member is residing at. You must also not do the following:

    • Power trip or issue no-cause punishments.

    • Disclose confidential Staff information or messages from restricted channels.

    • Provide bypasses to automod or other security systems.

- **Enforcing Rules**

Within your application, you understood the rules enough to make it to the stage where you are reading this. 
However, there is a chance you do not know everything there is to know about the rules. 
The `global server rules documentation`_ is available for reading to help you understand the rules and what is or isn't a violation.

Conclusion
------------

- **Word from Eternalll**

This Discord was created all the way back in December 2017 when I could not find a Der Riese game on Black Ops 1 PC. 
Disatisfied with the lack of a central community to find competent players, fans of zombies, and more, 
I set out to create a community that would perform this exact objective. Furthermore, I wanted to foster an advertisement, cheat, and drama free environment. 
This environment is constantly growing and changing, you are volunteering to help keep it consistent and a great choice of server for those looking for groups for zombies. 
Thank you for contributing your time to allow others to peacefully game on and grow their love for Zombies more, creating new memories.

    :ref:`If you are not assigned a mentor by the person onboarding you by the end of the process, please go back and ask for one.`
