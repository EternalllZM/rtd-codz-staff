Appeal Guide

User Process
------------

When the user is banned, they are sent a message with a link to the appeal server. 
Once they join the appeal server, they are put into an empty channel where they are to read `click and read their own appeal guide`.

Moderator Process
------------

1. View the **#appeals** channel and review all the information within the appeal.

2. Identify in the main server who performed the punishment.

3. Senior Moderator or above may decide (with enough information) on the appeal themselves.

4. Ideally, put the decision upon the person who made the punishment.

5. Accept or deny the appeal.

- **Intervention**

You may choose to create an intervention within the server for the person who was banned. 
Click the button in the **#intervention** channel to create it and then add the person you want in the appeal.

- **Viewing Users**

Since Staff are hidden from the appealers, there is a dedicated command to view users within the server. **!currentusers** will target all non-Staff users within the server.

- **Accepting Appeals**

To accept an appeal, run **!acceptappeal <id>** to send the verdict and notify Senior Staff to unban the user.

.. important::
    :ref:`Bans that were made in error result in the user being kicked from the server instead of banned post-acceptance.`

.. warning::
    :ref:`Do not run the accept appeal command on those who were banned in error. Since errors are made infrequently, you will open an intervention and guide them back onto the server.`

- **Post-Appeal**

After accepting, a timer is set on the user for 12 hours for them to rejoin before a ban is placed. 
If they leave within this time period, they will still be banned as that is what happens when the appeal is accepted.

.. note::
    :ref:`Bans that were valid mean the user does not get another appeal.`

.. tip::
    :ref:`If you are having trouble throughout any part of this process, ask for help.`
